# DIGITAL OBJECT COUNTER 
# Abstract
This Project is based on the  Digital Object Counter system using Arduino
Nano, Ky -023 sensor,LCD dispaly,7 segment display, push button. Object  
sensor and counteris a reliable circuit whichovertakes the role of counting 
number of objects  in thestore. When any object is paced when it passes the 
sensor , the counter is incremented by one and the total number of objects 
present in the store  is displayed on LCD.Microcontroller is used here to
make a securecount over a large number of objects.It gets the signals from 
the sensors and these signals are stored in ROM. Main application is counting 
objects or merchandise in industrial sector.

# REQUIREMENTS
The main goal of the proect is in the industry to reduce the man power for counting the objects.
And it is useful for inport export of objects,used in gatherings family occasions.
# Features
* Easily counts the number of objets.
* Time taken is less.
* Low cost
# RESEARCH
Measurement, counting to be exact plays an important role in nature and human existence. It
is a broad discipline in both engineering and science encompassing the areas of detection,
acquisition, control, and analysis of different data. Measurement provides means of describing
natural, human, and artificial activities in quantitative terms. It comprises the precise and
accurate measurement and recording of physical and non-physical parameters that play a vital
role in every branch of scientific research and industrial processes.
# 5W'S & 1H
# Who
* This project helps the industrial growth by reducing the number of labour work
# What
* This model heps to count the number of objects with the help of sensor and controller.
# When 
* Implemented at intial satges of making big industry
# Where
* Useful in big industries,gatherings family occasions(future scope),inport and export realted work.
# Why
* Useful beacuse it easily shows with help of lcd display how many objets are there at present.
# How
* When any object is paced when it passes the 
sensor , the counter is incremented by one and the total number of objects 
present in the store  is displayed on LCD.Microcontroller is used here to
make a securecount over a large number of objects.
