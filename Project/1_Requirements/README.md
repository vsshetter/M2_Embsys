# DIGITAL OBJECT COUNTER 
# Abstract
This Project is based on the  Digital Object Counter system using Arduino
Nano, Ky -023 sensor,LCD dispaly,7 segment display, push button. Object sensor and counteris a reliable circuit which
overtakes the role of counting number of objects  in the
store. When any object is paced when it passes th sensor , the counter is incremented
by one and the total number of objects  present in the store  is
displayed on LCD.Microcontroller is used here to make a secure
count over a large number of objects.It gets the signals from the
sensors and these signals are stored in ROM. Main application is counting objects or merchandise in industrial sector.
