# WATER LEVEL INDICATOR
# Abstract
This Project is based on the  Digital Object Counter system using Arduino
Nano, Ky-023 sensor,LCD dispaly,7 segment display, push button. Object  
sensor and counteris a reliable circuit whichovertakes the role of counting 
number of objects  in thestore. When any object is paced when it passes the 
sensor , the counter is incremented by one and the total number of objects 
present in the store  is displayed on LCD.Microcontroller is used here to
make a securecount over a large number of objects.It gets the signals from 
the sensors and these signals are stored in ROM. Main application is counting 
objects or merchandise in industrial sector.

# REQUIREMENTS
The main goal of the proect is in the industry to reduce the man power for counting the objects.
And it is useful for inport export of objects,used in gatherings family occasions.
# Features
* Easily counts the number of objets.
* Time taken is less.
* Low cost
# RESEARCH
Measurement, counting to be exact plays an important role in nature and human existence. It
is a broad discipline in both engineering and science encompassing the areas of detection,
acquisition, control, and analysis of different data. Measurement provides means of describing
natural, human, and artificial activities in quantitative terms. It comprises the precise and
accurate measurement and recording of physical and non-physical parameters that play a vital
role in every branch of scientific research and industrial processes.
# 5W'S & 1H
# Who
* This project helps the industrial growth by reducing the number of labour work
# What
* This model heps to count the number of objects with the help of sensor and controller.
# When 
* Implemented at intial satges of making big industry
# Where
* Useful in big industries,gatherings family occasions(future scope),inport and export realted work.
# Why
* Useful becacuse it easily shows with help of lcd display how many objets are there at present.
# How
* When any object is paced when it passes the 
sensor , the counter is incremented by one and the total number of objects 
present in the store  is displayed on LCD.Microcontroller is used here to
make a securecount over a large number of objects.
# High level requirements
| id | High level requirements |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| HL1 | System should be specified towards counting the objects   |
| HL2 | Push buttons are needded to use for set or reset  |
| HL3 | The controller and sensor must be in synchronization  | 
| HL4 | System shall use 7 segment to dispaly the count  |

# Low level requirements
| Id | Low level requirements for HL1 |
| ---------------| ---------------------|
| LLR 1.1 | Prompting the user to set the counter limit and count limit reach notification |              
| LLR 1.2 | Displaying the current count and showing the last count value etc |  

| Id | Low level requirements for HL2 |
| ---------------| ---------------------|
| LLR 2.1 | Set and reset buttons are used setting the count limit | 
| LLR 2.2 | Up and down push buttons are used incresaing or decreasing                                                                                                                       value repectively | 

| Id | Low level requirements for HL3|                                                                   
| ---------------| ---------------------|                                                                 
| LLR 3.1 |  Object is paced when it passes the sensor , the counter is incremented by one count |                                                                               
| LLR 3.2 | Controller  gets the signals from the sensors and these signals are stored in ROM |

| Id |  Low level requirements for HL4 | 
| ---------------| ---------------------|
| LLR 4.1 | Display is driven by MAX 7219 IC |
| LLR 4.2 | Output should be error less |     

# SWOT ANALYSIS
# STRENGHT 
* Less human interaction .
* count limit is used by push buttons.
* easy to use.
# WEAKNESS
* Not connected to internet.
* Unable to monitor through the phone.
* Deadlines.
# OPPURTUNITIES
* Less cost.
* It consumes less power.
* Scope of this system is very huge in human automation.
# THREATS
* System won't work if power is not there.
* Best applications are avalible.
* Mainatinance.
# APPLICATIONS
* The  system is  designed to  use at  places like  laboratories  or classrooms where the intensity of crowd is intermediate. 
* The system  can  be  enhanced  by installing  industrial  IR  sensors which have better sensitivity at detecting objects at sufficient
* The data can be sent to  cloud and store it for future use. 
* The data can also be monitored live for security purposes and can be used for further IOT applications.
