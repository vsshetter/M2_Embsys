# 1 WATER LEVEL INDICATOR
# 1.1 Abstract
* We live in a world which is moving at such a fast pace that everything if automated will help us to keep our lives
going. The project on water level Indicator will help us to know when the water in our tanks is either full or empty
and automatically switch on and off the pump as and when necessary.
* By using the basic principle of ultrasonicsensors, i.e the ECHO method, we calculate the time of the ultrasonic waves 
travelling to and fro and after a few calculations the answer obtained will be the water level in the tank. By using
this concept, the water pump is switched on or off automatically when the water level falls below a certain level. 

# 1.2 Identifying Features
* It should be power saver.
  * Money saver.
  * Automatic.
  * Easy Insatllation.
* Should monitor the level of water in the tank and simultaneously switches on the water pump whenever the water level goes low in the water tank.
* By using the water level indicator we can overcome the overflow of water from the tankers.
* Time taken to produce output is less.
* LCD disaply always needs to give the current water level.

# 1.3 RESEARCH
* In relation with the current framework with so much work and too less time to spare, it is very difficult to keep in
touch with the water level in the tanks. Water is essential in every hour of our lives. Hardly anyone keeps in track of
the level of water in the overhead tanks. The objective of the project is to measure the level of water in the tank and
notify the user about the water level through an SMS alert.
* This not only helps to keep the tank full but also making it more convenient for our day-to-day chores and also avoiding 
water wastage. In this project, the water is being measured by using ultrasonic sensors. Initially, the tank is considered 
to be empty. When the sound waves are transmitted in the environment, they are reflected back as ECHO. This same concept 
is applied this project. Waves generated by the ultrasonic sensors is sent to the water tank and their time of travelling 
and coming back is noted and after few calculations we can estimate the level of water in the tank.

# High level requirements
| Id | High level requirements |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| HL1 | System should control motor,LCD display,sensor using ARDUINO controller   |
| HL2 | There shall be a LCD to dispaly the current state   |
| HL3 | LED is used for open and close valve indication  |
| HL4 | Ultrasonic sensor used to measure the distance  |

# Low level requirements
| Id | Low level requirements for HL1 |
| ---------------| ---------------------|
| LLR 1.1 | According to pin configuration LCD,motor,sensor are controlled by ARDUINO  |
| LLR 1.2 | As potentiometer valuve changes the valuve in LCD display changes and with help of ARDUINO servo motor direction changes |

| Id | Low level requirements for HL2 |
| ---------------| ---------------------|
| LLR 2.1 | LCD is used to dispaly the remaining sapce in the tank  | 
| LLR 2.2 | LCD also displays the message for close and open valves | 

| Id | Low level requirements for HL3|                                                                   
| ---------------| ---------------------|                                                                 
| LLR 3.1 |  LEDS and servo motors are synchronized |                                                                               
| LLR 3.2 | Voltmeter is used for  varying vlotage at initial zero volts one LED IS OFF and other one is ON  |

| Id |  Low level requirements for HL4 | 
| ---------------| ---------------------|
| LLR 4.1 | when distance is < = 100 close the valve(because only 100 cm space is left in tank).|
| LLR 4.2 | Whatever the distance is dispalyed by lcd with the help of Ultrasonic is the amount of space left in the tank |     

# SWOT ANALYSIS
# STRENGHT 
* Less human interaction .
* count limit is used by push buttons.
* easy to use.
# WEAKNESS
* Not connected to internet.
* Unable to monitor through the phone.
* Deadlines.
# OPPURTUNITIES
* Less cost.
* It consumes less power.
* Scope of this system is very huge in human automation.
# THREATS
* System won't work if power is not there.
* Best applications are avalible.
* Mainatinance.
# APPLICATIONS
* The  system is  designed to  use at  places like  laboratories  or classrooms where the intensity of crowd is intermediate. 
* The system  can  be  enhanced  by instaling  industrial  IR  sensors which have better sensitivity at detecting objects at sufficient
* The data can be sent to  cloud and store it for future use. 
* The data can also be monitored live for security purposes and can be used for further IOT applications.
