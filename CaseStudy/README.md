# LOW LEVEL EMBEDDED SYSTEMS


# Vehicle Speed Limitor 

# Introduction
Over speeding vehicle make lot of problems sometimes also leading to loss of lives and other damages. Also imposing speed restrictions through sign boards have been rendered fruitless wherein the vehicle drivers do not comply with it and resulting catastrophic. Vehicle Speed Limit Controller Project is a great solution to this problem as it not only provides speed limitations, it also implements it through a controlling mechanism. 

# Components
* Hardware : Buttons and electronic circuitry, resistors ,capacitors, transistors cables and connectors diodes pcb and breadboards led, atmega microcontroller, rf module, 9V battery, dc motor ,lcd display, crystal oscillator
* Software : Programming language c
* Mechanical : The project works with RF communication between the speed sign post and the vehicle controller system. A motor is used here to depict as a vehicle. Whenever a vehicle comes in range of the RF speed sign post, the sign post transmits the speed limit for that particular road to the vehicle system.  

# Component Description
* Microcontroller : This is the cpu of our project.We are going to use a microcontroller of 8051 family.
* LCD : The speed of the vehicle and the limits are displayed on an LCD. 
* Push Buttons :The speed of the vehicle can be incremented / decremented manually with the help of push buttons.
